# Big-Data-Analysis-using-Apache-Spark
Introduction
This project will have you perform Data Analysis and processing using Spark SQL. The Project will use the data from https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/. This project will use only 16 years of weather data (2000 - 2018) for all the stations starting with US and elements TMAX, TMIN. In particular, it will have you build a hadoop map/reduce or Apache Spark that yields the following analysis: 
● Average TMIN, TMAX for each year excluding abnormalities or missing data 
● Maximum TMAX, Minimum TMIN for each year excluding abnormalities or missing data 
● 5 hottest, 5 coldest weather stations for each year excluding abnormalities or missing data 
● Hottest and coldest day and corresponding weather stations in the entire dataset.
